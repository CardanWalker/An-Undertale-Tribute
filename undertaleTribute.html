    <p>Undertale is one indie game that most gaming veterans would have played. Undertale is a game I played that has influenced my life the most.<br>
    It hurts that Toby Fox says he can no longer make any other game like it and I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this way.<br><br>
Anyways, here are the <strong>top 5 Things I loved about Undertale</strong></p>

    5. Papyrus' Optimism
</h2>
<hr>
<p>I played through all the main endings in Undertale and I have to say, Papyrus' optimism is extremely persistent.<br>
Even when I killed him without hesitation in the Genocide routes(Yes, I did a lot of Genocide routes. It's not my fault I wanted some difficulty :P), he stilled had hope for me.<br> That was very touching.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="music">4. The Undertale Music</h2>
    <hr>
    <P>Like... WOW. The music in the game added so much emotion while playing!<br>
    If I'm being very honest, besides from the storyline, this touched me the most and will forever remain in my memories.<br>
Songs like; Hopes and Dreams, Home, True battle against a true hero, Bonetrousle, and of course, Megalovania.</P>

    <h2 id="route">
        3. The route choice
    </h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Normally, I like games that determine the endings by my in-game actions and Undertale is probably the game that tops it off for me.<br>
    Just having multiple endings is not enough, you have to make the endings touch the player, and Undertale definetly touched me in so many ways!</p>
</div>
<div>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="chara">
        2. Chara
    </h2>
    <hr>
    <p id="charap">Hear me out. Everything about Chara, is amazing. If you're a chaotic person like me with a thirst for violence (in games that is. Let's not bring that to real life), you'll feel yourself resonate in Chara<br>
    And then, added to Chara's revengeful personality, we have the backstory. Chara being the first human to fall into the underground just has great importance, as Chara gave the first impression of humans to the monsters in a long time.<br>
    Here Chara pretty much plays the role of our story before our story even started. Not knowing much about Chara gives room for character development and most likely, more taouching experiences. But sadly now more undertale. But there is still hope for Deltarune!</p>
</div>
<div>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="sans">1. Sans</h2>
    <hr>
    <p id="sansp">Why sans is first is self-explanatory if you've played the game. Sure I could've just said the characters where my favourite part of the game, but there just had to be two sections for Sans and Chara.<br>
    Sans <em>humerous</em> and chill personality just allows players to relate with him pretty easily. Then, just like Chara, Sans backstory would also be a great thing if it wan't just theories people assumed to be true.<br>
    Sans being one of the only chaarcters that know about our resets is just making him even more cool. His aggressiveness towards Frisk at the end of the genocide route is something I've gotten addicted to. He still remains chill in some ways even though he knows his existence has been resting in the hands of a genocidal child.<br>
    There are a lot of other features of Sans that make me like him so much, but obviously I'm not typing all of that.</p>
